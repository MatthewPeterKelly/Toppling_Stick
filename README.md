# Toppling Stick: case study for sliding contact

Event-based simulation and analysis of a stick (pencil) falling over with careful attention being paid to how the contact mechanics are implemented. I wrote this simulation was made after reading Tad McGeer's 1989 paper: "wobbling, toppling, and forces of contact". It is designed to study the effects that moment of inertia and contact friction have on the outcome of the simulation. This code was used to write [chapter 6.5 of my PhD dissertation](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/44350) at Cornell, and is described in more detail there.

## Usage Guide:

`MAIN.m`
Runs a simulation.

`FIGURE*.m`
Batch run of simulation to generate a specific figure.
